This is a resume site for myself. The site was generated using Vercel's v0, https://v0.dev/t/MqW2cIkwT16. It was then heavily modified to break everything out into different components, and added functionality to break out my software engineering resume from my climbing resume. It has now evolved to not be quite so static and to use React Server Components.
