      <Section title="About Me">
        <p className={cn('mt-4 text-muted-foreground md:text-lg')}>
          I've been interested in and passionate about programming since I was a kid. I started tinkering on an old 486
          laptop with Borland C++ modifying examples to make fake installation applications. Once I got my Sony PSP in
          high school, I created and released homebrew applications. With that experience, I got a job out of high
          school with PosiMotion.
        </p>
        <p className={cn('mt-4 text-muted-foreground md:text-lg')}>
          Today, I still have a passion for programming with plenty of side projects outside of work, such as Outclimb,
          Prideful.li and my Nintendo Switch homebrew applications. I have also picked up a few more hobbies, such as
          rock climbing, hiking, and photography. In my free time, I also volunteer with Open Arms of Minnesota, helping
          to provide nourishing meals to critically ill individuals and their families.
